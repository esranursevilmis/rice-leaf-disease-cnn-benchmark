# CNN-based Rice Leaf Disease Classification

This project is inspired by the research paper titled *"An Efficient Deep Learning-based VGG19 Approach for Rice Leaf Disease Classification"*. The main objective is to experiment with various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures to classify rice leaf diseases using image data and to compare their classification accuracy and performance.

## ✅ Goal

- Implement and evaluate multiple CNN models including:
  - VGG19 (baseline from the original paper)
  - VGG16
  - MobileNetV2
  - ResNet50

- Compare model performances using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - Training and inference time

## 🧪 Status

- ✅ VGG19 implemented and trained successfully  
- 🔄 Currently testing MobileNetV2  
- 🔜 Other models in progress  

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle:  
📦 [Rice Leaf Disease Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nirmalsankalana/rice-leaf-disease-image)

## 📌 Note

This project is a work in progress. More CNN architectures and experimental results will be added over time.
