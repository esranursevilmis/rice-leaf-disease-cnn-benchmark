# 🌾 CNN-based Rice Leaf Disease Classification

This project is inspired by the research paper titled  
**"An Efficient Deep Learning-based VGG19 Approach for Rice Leaf Disease Classification"**.  
The main objective is to classify rice leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, and compare their classification accuracy and performance.

---

## ✅ Goal

- Implement and evaluate multiple CNN models:
  - ✅ VGG19 (baseline from the original paper)
  - ✅ VGG16
  - ✅ MobileNetV2

- Compare model performance using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - Training and inference time

---

## 📊 Results

- **VGG19** achieved high accuracy but with longer training time.
- **MobileNetV2** provided faster training and inference with efficient performance.
- **VGG16** also showed competitive results with a balance of accuracy and speed.
- Detailed evaluation metrics are provided in the results section.
